\begin{abstract}
\noindent This article introduces a midi score database. It is composed by (137 OU 224 si IMSLP, mais c'est tout faux) pairs of one piano score and one corresponding orchestration. To our best knowledge, this is the first database of this kind. Thus, we also introduce a projective orchestration task, which roughly consists in learning to perform automatic orchestration of a piano score. This task can be addressed using learning methods on this database.

\section{Introduction}
% Orchestration = definition
Orchestration is the subtle art of writing musical pieces for the orchestra by combining the properties of various instruments in order to achieve a particular sonic rendering. \cite{koechli_orch,Rimsky-Korsakov:1873aa}.
% Projective orchestration = définition, et usage fréquent dans la musique classique
Among the different writing techniques for orchestral works, one of them consists in first writing an harmonic and rhythmic structure in the form of a piano score and then adding the timbre dimension by spreading the different voices over the various instruments \cite{piston-orch}. 
Here timbre refers to the property which allows listeners to distinguish two sounds produced at the same pitch and intensity. 
We refer to this operation of extending a piano draft to an orchestral score as \textit{projective orchestration} \cite{eslingthesis}.
The orchestral repertoire contains a large number of examples of projective orchestration (such as the piano reductions by Liszt of Beethoven symphonies or the \textit{pictures at an exhibition}, a piano piece by Moussorgsky orchestrated by several notorious composers). By observing a case of projective orchestration (see \prettyref{fig:orch}), we can clearly see that this process involves more than the mere allocation of notes written on the piano score across the different instruments. It rather implies harmonic enhancements and timbre manipulations to underline the already existing harmonic and rhythmic structure \cite{mcadams2013timbre}.

\caption{\textit{Projective orchestration}. A piano score is projected on an orchestra. Even though a wide range of orchestrations exist for a given piano score, all of them will share strong relations with the original piano score. One given orchestration implicitly embeds the knowledge of the composer about timbre and orchestration.}

% Pourquoi c'est intéressant les orchestrations projectives ?
Observing projective orchestrations made by famous composers is highly informative. First because the orchestrated version highlights the structure analyzed by the composer. Then, because it gives precious informations about the timbral mapping performed by the composer.

For these reasons, we believe that the absence of a database of projective orchestration was an acute lack to the scientific study of orchestration.

In the remainder of this paper, we introduce the database we have constructed in section 1. More specifically, we describe its structure and the alignment algorithms we used to guarantee that the piano and orchestra scores are aligned. In section 2, we introduce an task that we called \textit{automatic projective orchestration}. We then detail our approach to tackle this newly introduced problem.

\section{Description of the database}
\subsection{Structure}
The database is composed by \textbf{NN} pairs of piano score and their orchestration. 
Each pair has a unique index.
The scores format is midi.

Because the scores come from different sources, we had to standardize  informations. Hence, for each midi file, a comma separated values (\textit{csv}) file link the name of the midi tracks to an instrument name (exemple : \textit{pia_001} is linked to \textit{piano}).
Besides, a 
\subsection{Automatic alignment}
Since we gathered files from various origins, we had to perform automatic alignment for each pair. We used a \textit{Needleman-Wunsch} based algorithm with a measure adapted to the musical context.
